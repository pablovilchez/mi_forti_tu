# 📱 Mi Fortitú
Mi Fortitú is a mobile app built for 42 students who want to enhance their daily campus experience. Originally developed as a personal specialization project in Flutter, the app has evolved into a rich, gamified tool that connects with the official 42 API and brings useful features to life.

The app is tailored for academic and competitive use inside 42 campuses and offers campus-based insights, league and tournament tools, and more.


⚠️ Limited access: As the app is in early testing, access is restricted to a small group of approved users to prevent exceeding API quotas.
